Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. 

Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. 

Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.
The basic Python data structures in Python include list, set, tuples, and dictionary. 

Each of the data structures is unique in its own way. Data structures are “containers” that organize and group data according to type.

-Lists, sets, and tuples are the basic data structures in the Python programming language.
-One of the differing points among the data structures is mutability, which is the ability to change an object after its creation.
-Lists and tuples are the most useful data types, and they can be found in virtually every Python program.

* A list is defined as an ordered collection of items, and it is one of the essential data structures when using Python to create a project. 
The term “ordered collections” means that each item in a list comes with an order that uniquely identifies them. The order of elements is an 
inherent characteristic that remains constant throughout the life of the list.

* A set is defined as a unique collection of unique elements that do not follow a specific order. Sets are used when the existence of an object
in a collection of objects is more important than the number of times it appears or the order of the objects. Unlike tuples, sets are mutable. 

– They can be modified, added, replaced, or removed. A sample set can be represented as follows:

set_a = {“item 1”, “item 2”, “item 3”,….., “item n”}
