 Variable

Variables are containers for storing data values.

A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. 
Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name. But the data itself is still contained within the object.

Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Ex:- x = 5
     y = "John"
     
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

#Data type

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has data types built-in by default such as:- str, int, float, complex, list, tuple, bool...

In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable.

If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions.
