Python Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

-while loops
-for loops

# while Loop
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

Ex:- i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
  
# For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.  

The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items.

Ex:- fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
     for x in fruits:
     print(x)
     if x == "banana":
     break
