Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

the decorators are used to modify the behaviour of function or class. In Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another
function and then called inside the wrapper function.

decorator is a callable function, that will add some code on the top of some another callable function, hello_decorator function and return the wrapper function.
